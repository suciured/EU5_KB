AUTHORITY LEDGER — DESIGN INTENT (PLAIN TEXT)

GOAL
----
Replace all base-game country titles and names (Kingdom, Republic, Empire, etc.)
with a single, unified system called R-Ranks.

R-Ranks are custom, player-selectable political rank names (e.g. Holding,
Commune, Realm,  Empire) that apply to ALL countries, player and AI,
at all times.

Use the Title flavor mod as a reference to make a chart that allows you to manually chose a title

There should never be a fallback to vanilla titles.

CORE PRINCIPLES
---------------
1. EU5 still internally uses the four hard tiers:
   - County
   - Duchy
   - Kingdom
   - Empire
   These CANNOT be removed mechanically.

2. Authority Ledger hides those tiers completely at the presentation layer.

3. Every country ALWAYS displays:
   <R-Rank> of <Country Name>

4. Government types (monarchy, republic, etc.) NEVER control the country name.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
---------------
The system is composed of four layers:

LAYER 1 — VARIABLES (R-Rank Selection)
Each R-Rank is represented by a country variable, e.g.:
  rank_county_??
  rank_dutchy_??
  rank_kingdom_??
  rank_empire_??


LAYER 2 — SCRIPTED LOCALIZATION (Rank Resolution)
A scripted localization function (GetAuthorityLedgerRank) evaluates:
- the country’s tier (county/duchy/kingdom/empire)
- which R-Rank variable is set

It returns a LOCALIZATION KEY, not raw text.

Example:
  rank_county_holding  ->  "Holding"
  rank_kingdom_realm   ->  "Realm"

This avoids raw-key display like:
  rank_county_holding of Florence

LAYER 3 — COUNTRY NAME OVERRIDE
All vanilla country name definitions (Republic of X, Kingdom of X, etc.)
are disabled.

A single replacement rule is used globally:

  localization_key = R_RANK


This applies to:
- player countries
- AI countries
- subjects
- released nations

LAYER 4 — DEFAULT FALLBACKS (NO BLANKS)
If a country has no R-Rank variable set, a forced default applies:

  County   -> County
  Duchy   -> Duchy
  Kingdom -> Kingdom
  Empire  -> Empire

This guarantees the name never starts blank or black.

UI RULES (AUTHORITY LEDGER WINDOW)
---------------------------------
- The UI ONLY shows R-Ranks.
- Vanilla titles (King, Duke, Emperor, etc.) do not appear unless as a final fallback.
- The UI filters by tier:
  - County-tier countries only see county ranks
  - Duchy-tier only duchy ranks
  - etc.

Button labels must display LOCALIZED names, not raw keys.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

You must only create mod files based on the reference mods OR the template mod. Also do not make up any information and only use what is given to you via KB TXT files. this includes everything in the base file
